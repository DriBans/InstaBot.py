### InstaBot

In this repository, I try making a bot using Python and InstaBot module, but I won't actually create a bot for Instagram since there were already codes. I am here to hone my skills and develop new things while doing this.

Bots have become an usual thing amongst tech people. Bots reduce work load and save time as well. Here is the following functions performed:
- Follow one or more of friends.
- Unfollow one or a list of persons.
- Unfollow everyone.
- Count the number of followers of any user.
- Send messages to followers or a list of followers.
- Send like on chat.
- Post photos.
